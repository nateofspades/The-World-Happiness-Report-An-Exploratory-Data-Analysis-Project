# The World Happiness Report - EDA

The project can be seen in the .ipynb file.

### Introduction
This EDA project looks at data from the 2015, 2016 and 2017 iterations of the World Happiness Report to see how various characteristics of a country correlate with the mean subjective happiness scores of a country. I also used the ggmap API to extract map data. The WHR data and the ggmap data were relatively clean in isolation, but some data preprocessing had to be done when joining the two.

### The characteristics (at the level of countries): <br />
•GDP per capita <br />
•Family quality <br />
•Health <br />
•Freedom <br />
•Generosity <br />
•Trust in Government

### The target variable (at the level of countries):  <br />
•Mean subjective happiness score

### Happiness Heat Map
A heat map of the world where countries are colored by their happiness scores reveals a strong positive correlation between how developed a country is and how happy its average citizen is. Australia, New Zealand, North America and Western Europe are the happiest regions of the world, while Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia are the least happy regions of the world.
